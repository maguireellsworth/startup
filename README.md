# Keep Me Posted

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application will allow you to follow your favorite developers and makers. Upon entering the application you will be taken to the homepage where you will find all the latest post-its (updates) from the projects you are following. You can also select a specific creator to see the last 10 updates that they have posted. Or create your own post-its for you own projects.


## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown - used markdown cheat sheet for all added content
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch - added elevator pitch that even my grandma is proud of
- [x] Description of key features - Short sweet and to the point list of key features

### Elevator pitch

Too many indie developers get caught up in the development that their paying followers (go-fund-me, kickstarter, etc.) dont get updates, start to believe they've been scammed, and eventually start to demand their money back. That's where Keep Me Posted comes in. It's a low stress, low upkeep, and fun way for makers to tell their fans that they're still alive and working on their next favorite indie game. Posts can be as simple as a screenhot, heck, tell them you got out of bed today! Keep everyone updated on Keep Me Posted!

     - Login
     - Retrieve posts
     - Recieve user interactions with posts
- **DB/Login** - Will be used for the following:
     - Register users
     - Store users, following lists, posts, and post interactions
     - Can't make posts unless authenticated
- **WebSocket** - Notification system for post interaction and automatic loading of any new post-its

- [x] **Responsive to window resizing** - A bit janky at weird sizes but full size monitor and standard phones sizes are all flawless.
- [x] **Application elements** - Found a color palette online that I liked and made posts look like post-its
- [x] **Application text content** - Used 'Fira Code' for my font as it is kind of retro but not annoying

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown - used markdown cheat sheet for all added content
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch - added elevator pitch that even my grandma is proud of
- [x] Description of key features - Short sweet and to the point list of key features

### Elevator pitch

Too many indie developers get caught up in the development that their paying followers (go-fund-me, kickstarter, etc.) dont get updates, start to believe they've been scammed, and eventually start to demand their money back. That's where Keep Me Posted comes in. It's a low stress, low upkeep, and fun way for makers to tell their fans that they're still alive and working on their next favorite indie game. Posts can be as simple as a screenhot, heck, tell them you got out of bed today! Keep everyone updated on Keep Me Posted!

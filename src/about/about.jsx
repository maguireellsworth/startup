                <p>Too many indie developers get caught up in the development that their paying followers (go-fund-me, kickstarter, etc.) dont get updates, start to believe they've been scammed, and eventually start to demand their money back. That's where Keep Me Posted comes in. It's a low stress, low upkeep, and fun way for makers to tell their fans that they're still alive and working on their next favorite indie game. Posts can be as simple as a screenhot, heck, tell them you got out of bed today! Keep everyone updated on KeepMePosted!</p>
